## History

version 1.0:
* add new items: sword (+1 attack) and shield (+1 defense)
* from Archifenix: put in menu screen that using F2 you can go fullscreen
* BUG From Archifenix: the text at the top is blocked from view until you repeat the same action a few times (fighting an aberration for example resulted in health being lost but the text only scrolling into view after the third or so hit)
* BUG from Pavel Provotorov: Sounds when the player/monster recieves damage
* BUG from Pavel Provotorov: Adding health bars to mosters. The combat is hard without those
* added new monsters: Fungus, Shade, Ring, Formian, RedFlame, BlueFlame
* level balancing for new monsters
